                <p>This is a refreshing salad using all different kinds of vegetables. You can use whatever you like,
                    but the main things that makes it good are the tomatoes and cucumbers. It is much like an Israeli
                    salad. </p>

                <p>These individual meat loaves are topped with a sweet and tangy sauce. The sausage in this recipe
                    yields a more complex flavor than your standard meat loaf. If you taste this you won't regret.</p>

                <img src="images/Project Cover.png" width="200" alt="">
                <p>With the slightly sweet, somewhat salty, and subtly smoky flavor of the ham, this hearty soup is the
                    ideal fall or winter soup -- a great one for lunches, or as a starter for dinner.</p>
